# üëã About Me

I‚Äôm a Senior Technical Advisor (AI) for the Australian Public Service, with a background spanning Systems Engineering, Cyber Security, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Project Management. My work focuses on the intersection of AI, simulation, and security in complex, critical environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Expertise

- **AI & Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**
- **Systems Engineering**
- **Cyber Security**
- **Python Development**
- **Simulation & Modelling**
- **C4ISR Systems**
- **Project Management**
- **Root Cause Analysis & Critical Situation Management**

## üß† Domain Specialisations

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Simulation, Modelling, and Game Design
- Cyber Security (with a focus on safety-critical applications)
- C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance)

## üí° Key Projects

- **Keisei**: A DRL tech demonstrator teaching an AI to play Shogi, also serving as a proof of concept for a modular DRL training harness.
- **Kasima**: An implementation of "Morphogenetic Architectures"‚Äîa novel framework for adaptive neural networks, enabling localized, seed-driven evolution within otherwise static models. This approach supports the emergence of new capabilities in resource-constrained or safety-critical scenarios, without the need for retraining entire systems.

_Note: Most of my projects and major systems are named after characters from Magic the Gathering (MTG) lore._

## üé≤ Interests

- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Simulation & Modelling
- Game Design
- Magic the Gathering (MTG)

## üó®Ô∏è Availability

I‚Äôm open to consultation and technical discussion! However, due to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Level 2 and a tendency to get distracted, I can‚Äôt reasonably commit to long-term collaborations.
